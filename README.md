# steamreviews - 

This contains my python code looking at steamreviews data from 2015 to 2019. I wanted to examine if a product going into early access would impact reviews from steam users. By the end you can examine that there does seem to be a relationship however it doesn't seem to have a large impact on whether a game gets positive reviews; but it absolutely does seem to be present. Furthermore I graphed the change and growth of steam reviews from its start in 2013 to 2019. the data cut off during some point in 2019 which is the reason why the year appears to have less reviews. 

This dataset was very clean which makes me believe the original poster on Kaggle found the dataset elsewhere then cleaned it before posting it. However I have been unable to find an original copy which makes this project unviable for demostrating my data manipulation skills in significant detail. That being said I believe the analysis is still worth it and yielded interesting outcomes. Steam reviews are rapidly growing and early access games seem to also be a signifcant part of that growth. If you're interested in the source of my data it below.

UPDATE: I have since discovered the steam API neccesary for gathering up to date data; I intend to time to look into collecting that data running my analysis over a more complete data set. This current set misses out on the entire covid era and the steam platform has only grown since 2019.
