# steamreviews - 

This contains my python code looking at steamreviews data from 2015 to 2019. I wanted to examine if a product going into early access would impact reviews from steam users. By the end you can examine that there does seem to be a relationship however it doesn't seem to have a large impact on whether a game gets positive reviews; but it absolutely does seem to be present.

To run this code you will need an application that reads python code and packages; and the CSV file which can be obtained via a link below to the kaggle dataset, you will for the time being need to rewrite the 'read_csv' line to where ever you download the csv file. I am currently looking into a solution that will not require this workaround. This dataset was very clean which makes me believe the original poster on Kaggle found the dataset elsewhere then cleaned it before posting it. However I have been unable to find an original copy which makes this project unviable for demostrating my data manipulation skills in significant detail. That being said I believe the analysis is still worth it and yielded interesting outcomes.
